I took a fun course on Software-Defined Networking (with P4), which included a project. Here is what I did and learned.

## P4 notes

### Useful links:

* P4 spec: <https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html>
* P4 includes: <https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/p4include/>
  * standard_metadata_t: <https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/p4include/v1model.p4#L32>
  * core: <https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/p4include/core.p4>

### How to...

* work with tables: <https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html#sec-tables>

* add headers:
  * order is the expected one: outside to inside
  * before setting stuff in a header, it must be .setValid()
  * when cloning packets, standard_metadata aren't copied => if I need that stuff later, I have to carry them around in metadata
* add an extern to the compiler and emulator: <https://github.com/joelwanner/p4c/compare/master...joelwanner:extern>, <https://github.com/joelwanner/behavioral-model/compare/master...joelwanner:extern>

### Multicast

* **multicast group** is a thingy with an ID, created via _control plane_ and used from _data plane_
  * CLI for creating it: `mc_mgrp_create <group_id>`
  * using it from P4 code: `standard_metadata.mcast_grp = 47`
* **multicast node** is for informing the switch that this port can be used for multicast. Nodes are associated with (/put into) groups. Usually there would be a 1:1 correspondence with a port, but it can be multiple ports too -- that makes sense if these ports will always be used together.
  * CLI for making a multicast node from a port: `mc_node_create <node_id> <port_number(s)>`
    * this returns a `node handle ID`, which is numbered from 0 in the order it was created ==> first node will be handle ID 0, second handle ID 1...
    * in order to make it even more confusing, `node_id` is actually called "replication ID"
    * **multicast nodes** are assigned into **multicast groups** by the control plane via CLI: `mc_node_associate <mcast_grp_id> <node_handle_id>` (many nodes to 1 group)  

therefore:

1. create group in control plane: `mc_mgrp_create 1`
2. create multicast node(s): `mc_node_create 0 1 2 3`
3. put nodes into groups: `mc_node_associate 1 0`

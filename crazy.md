Lightly edited from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder):

> Borderline personality disorder (BPD; also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder) is a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive, long-term pattern of significant interpersonal relationship instability, a distorted sense of self, and intense emotional responses. People diagnosed with BPD frequently exhibit self-harming behaviours and engage in risky activities, primarily due to challenges regulating emotional states to a healthy, stable baseline. Symptoms such as dissociation (a feeling of detachment from reality), a pervasive sense of emptiness, and an acute fear of abandonment are prevalent among those affected.

> The onset of BPD symptoms can be triggered by events that others might perceive as normal. BPD is associated with a substantial risk of suicide; studies estimated that up to 10 percent of people with BPD die by suicide. Despite its severity, BPD faces significant stigmatization in both media portrayals and the psychiatric field, potentially leading to underdiagnosis and insufficient treatment.

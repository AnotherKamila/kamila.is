I am a nerdy nerd, currently working as a [site reliability engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) at [the Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/) (yes, if Wikipedia breaks, it's probably my problem). I also aspire to be a lot of other things, such as:

- **a scientist** in how I think, because the world is wonderfully interesting, and things deserve a rational approach
- **a small aircraft pilot**, because when in the sky, all the troubles of daily life are left far below
- **a flutist**, because music feels like it comes from a better world
- **[an artist](/making)**, because making things is great
- **a helpful person**, because despite being a little afraid of people, I like <strike>them</strike> you!
